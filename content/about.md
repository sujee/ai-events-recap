# About AI Events Recap

Welcome to AI Events Recap.  I created this website to solve a problem I have been having.

There are lot of great AI events (conferences / meetups) going around the world.  And most of them post the talks and workshops online.

But ironically, this content is not easy to find.  The conference website goes dormant after conference.  Finding the posted content takes searching around.

So I started the site, to list good content from events.

## How to Submit Conference Content

Here is our [github repo](https://github.com/sujee/ai-events-recap)

Open an issue. 

Even better, open a PR.  See submission format in [here](https://github.com/sujee/ai-events-recap)
